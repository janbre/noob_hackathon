The course attempts to provide the knowledge about how molecular mechanisms can be the cause of physiological processes and how these mechanisms are regulated, which is the so-called molecular physiology. \r\nThe PhD research program is often like \"one gene, one PhD student.\"  The idea behind this kind of research approach is that the whole of a living system can be understood by studying its individual parts, identifying the subset of genes and proteins that function in physiological context or malfunction to trigger disease.  This so-called \"mechanistic\" approach has been conceived in hopes of understanding the biological system and of targeting the weak links in the system, fixing them, and eradicating the disease, referred as \"molecular medicine.\"\r\nAs science and technology rapidly develop, there are more and more tools to intervene and more and more parameters to be measured. Currently, we are able to study the expression of thousands of genes or hundreds of proteins at a time by high-through-put microarray technologies, providing a far more detailed molecular snapshot of life inside normal and abnormal cells. We attempt to study how the millions of molecules inside cells are organized into vast protein networks whose collective whole is greater than the individual parts. To meet this need,  a novel approach, the so-called \"systems biology\", has been developing based on molecular biology in its special concern for the information transfer and on molecular physiology for its particularly dealing with adaptive states of the cell and organism."},{"code":"KURSMAT","name":"Kursmateriell","text":"Reviews, original articles and prints of the lecture ppt with note pages."}],"assessment":[{"code":"M","codeName":"Muntlig","combinationCode":"M","combinationName":"Muntlig","firstExecutionYear":2012,"firstExecutionTerm":"Autumn","realExecutionYear":2012,"realExecutionTerm":"Autumn","date":"2012-12-10","statusCode":"ORD","statusName":"Ordin\u00e6r eksamen","gradeWeightingNumerator":100,"gradeWeightingDenominator":100,"duration":0,"deadlineBackOut":"2012-11-15","assessmentFormCode":"M","assessmentFormDescription":"Muntlig eksamen","assessmentTimeCode":"12","partNr":1,"registrationDeadline":"2012-09-15","gradeRuleScheme":"4","gradeRuleSchemeName":"Best\u00e5tt\/Ikke best\u00e5tt","gradeRuleUnit":"4","gradeRuleUnitName":"Best\u00e5tt\/Ikke best\u00e5tt"},{"code":"M","codeName":"Muntlig","combinationCode":"M","combinationName":"Muntlig","firstExecutionYear":2013,"firstExecutionTerm":"Spring","realExecutionYear":2013,"realExecutionTerm":"Spring","statusCode":"ORD","statusName":"Ordin\u00e6r eksamen","gradeWeightingNumerator":100,"gradeWeightingDenominator":100,"duration":0,"deadlineBackOut":"2013-04-30","assessmentFormCode":"M","assessmentFormDescription":"Muntlig eksamen","assessmentTimeCode":"06","partNr":1,"registrationDeadline":"2013-02-15","gradeRuleScheme":"4","gradeRuleSchemeName":"Best\u00e5tt\/Ikke best\u00e5tt","gradeRuleUnit":"4","gradeRuleUnitName":"Best\u00e5tt\/Ikke best\u00e5tt"}],"educationLanguage":[{"code":"ENGELSK","name":"Engelsk","norwegianName":"Engelsk","englishName":"English"}],"educationalRole":[{"code":"SubjectLecturer","name":"Fagl\u00e6rer","term":"Autumn","personId":519803,"person":{"personId":519803,"dateOfBirth":null,"gender":"Male","firstName":"Steinar","lastName":"Lundgren","displayName":"Steinar Lundgren","email":"steinar.lundgren@ntnu.no","publicationStatus":"NotReserved","username":"steinalu","employee":true,"affiliated":false,"student":false}},{"code":"SubjectLecturer","name":"Fagl\u00e6rer","term":"Autumn","personId":524380,"person":{"personId":524380,"dateOfBirth":null,"gender":"Female","firstName":"Chun-Mei","lastName":"Zhao","displayName":"Chun-Mei Zhao","email":"chun-mei.zhao@ntnu.no","publicationStatus":"NotReserved","username":"chunmei","officeAddress":"Laboratoriesenteret*231.03.01, Erling Skjalgssons g 1","phone":"72573080","employee":true,"affiliated":false,"student":false}},{"code":"Coordinator","name":"Koordinator","term":"Autumn","personId":525765,"person":{"personId":525765,"dateOfBirth":null,"gender":"Male","firstName":"Duan","lastName":"Chen","displayName":"Duan Chen","email":"duan.chen@ntnu.no","publicationStatus":"NotReserved","username":"duanc","officeAddress":"Laboratoriesenteret*LS21.137, Erling Skjalgssons g 1","phone":"72573320","mobilePhone":"93246129","employee":true,"affiliated":false,"student":false}}],"educationTerm":[{"termNum":1,"startTerm":"Autumn","termApplies":"Autumn","year":2012,"yearIncrement":0,"registrationDeadline":"2012-09-15","numOfRegistratedStudents":8}],"mandatoryActivity":[{"number":1,"name":"Forelesninger"},{"number":2,"name":"Individuelle diskusjoner med fageksperter"},{"number":3,"name":"Selvstudium"}],"subjectArea":[{"code":"MEDISIN","name":"Medisin","norwegianName":"Medisin","newNorwegianName":"Medisin","englishName":"Medicine"}],"usedInStudyprogrammes":[{"code":"PHMOLM","name":"Molekyl\u00e6rmedisin","englishName":"Molecular Medicine","statusUseCourseProgrammeConnectionInReporting":true,"statusPublishCourseInfoAsPartOfStudyProgramme":true,"requireSelectedInEducationPlan":false},{"code":"MD\/D","name":"Medisin doktorgrad","englishName":"Medicine, Doctoral Degree","statusUseCourseProgrammeConnectionInReporting":true,"statusPublishCourseInfoAsPartOfStudyProgramme":true,"requireSelectedInEducationPlan":false},{"code":"PHKLINM","name":"Klinisk medisin","englishName":"Clinical Medicine","statusUseCourseProgrammeConnectionInReporting":true,"statusPublishCourseInfoAsPartOfStudyProgramme":true,"requireSelectedInEducationPlan":false},{"code":"PHNEVRO","name":"Nevrovitenskap","englishName":"Neuroscience","statusUseCourseProgrammeConnectionInReporting":true,"statusPublishCourseInfoAsPartOfStudyProgramme":true,"requireSelectedInEducationPlan":false}]},"cache":{"updated":"2012-10-27T19:36:26+02:00","expires":"2012-11-03T18:36:26+01:00"},"request":{"courseCode":"mol8001","year":"2012","term":"autumn","language":"no"}}
