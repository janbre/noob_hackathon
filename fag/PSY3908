The student should contact teachers in the master programme for advice on choice of subject. Students are required to attend a seminar which aims at preparing the students for writing the thesis. Supervision is an important part of the work with the thesis. It will ensure that the students acquire relevant knowledge and  high standards in collection and analysis of data. The seminar will also ensure that the students follow the guidelines for research ethics. Supervision is therefore compulsory for every student that wishes to submit a master thesis.
