Candidates who did not study this subject should follow the lectures and study the readings of this course. As in GEOG 3518 different perspectives on globalization is presented, together with discussions on how this influences actions and strategies of entrepreses and national states. Focus is particularly on business practices in a globalized knowledge economy. Case examples are used to illustrate how businesses can draw on their surroundings and networks locally, regionally, nationally and internationally in their endeavours to innovate. The course presents how strategies and actions occur at the interface between economy and culture. Knowledge development across cultural boundaries is thus a central theme. This interdisciplinary course is founded on the collaboration between the Department of Geography and the Department of Industrial Economics and Technology \r\nManagement. \r\n\r\nGEOG 8518 is a reading course and the reading list will be decided upon individually. The paper can be handed in, in either English or Norwegian. \r\n"},{"code":"KURSMAT","name":"Kursmateriell"},{"code":"L\u00c6RFORM","name":"L\u00e6ringsformer og aktiviteter","text":"Paper.
