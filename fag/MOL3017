Knowledge about the normal microscopic appearance of cells and tissues is at the core of morphology. The course provides an overview of different methods for the study of tissue and cell structure, emphasising the respective advantages and limitations of different preparative procedures for light and electron microscopic visualisation. The course will give the students practical skills in preparation and microscopy of biological specimens. A main focus will be on interpretation of tissue and cell morphology. \r\n"},{"code":"KURSMAT","name":"Kursmateriell"},{"code":"L\u00c6RFORM","name":"L\u00e6ringsformer og aktiviteter","text":"Lectures, practical training sessions, and demonstrations.
