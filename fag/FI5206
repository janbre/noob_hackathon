Faced by the problems of balancing the vices and virtues, various scholars have called for a rethinking of prevailing ideals of just and desirable technology development. This course provides an introduction to these debates. We shall do so by pursuing questions like: How has technology traditionally been legitimised?   How can we avoid undesirable implications of technologies?  Are there any novel challenges of technology assessment in our time? Should lay-people be involved in technology assessments?  What are the relationships between technology and values? By entering various cases and technology controversies we shall simultaneously discuss and evaluate implications of various answers given to these questions.
