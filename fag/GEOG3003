It is comprised of two main parts: (1) a lecture \/ seminar part, (2) a field course with additional preparations and seminars. Various methodologies are practiced during the field course, in which students work in groups on particular topics and research objectives. The group work will form part of a common field course report. \r\n\r\nEmphasis is placed on developing a critical and reflexive attitude to the choice of research objective, research questions and the application of different methodologies. Some lectures will address the process with developing research objectives and choice of methodology for the master thesis. This process will end in a project assignment which delimits the theme, research objectives \/ questions and an assessment of researchdesign, appropriate methology and broader methods in the planned master thesis. \r\n"},{"code":"KURSMAT","name":"Kursmateriell"},{"code":"L\u00c6RFORM","name":"L\u00e6ringsformer og aktiviteter","text":"Field course, lectures: 10 hours, seminars: 8 hours.\r\nIt is expected that compulsories and examinations must be completed in English.
