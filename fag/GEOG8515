Candidates who have not taken this course should attend the GEOG 3515 lectures and read the course literature.\r\n\r\nAs in GEOG3515 this course explores different conceptualisations and (mis-) understandings of the links between development, environment and environmental change, and rural livelihood in African and Asian societies. The topics covered by the course include: *History of geographical thought: from environmental determinism to political ecology; *Social nature: social constructivism and environmental narratives; *Institutions, norms and collective action and the idea of the community as basis for natural resource management; *Hazards and vulnerability - Vulnerability: a useful concept or just another way of labelling; Vulnerability analysis in practice; *Environmental conservation and development: from Fortress conservation to Conservation and development; *Changing rural livelihoods and livelihood analysis: from farm to non-farm, and implications for the rural environments; * Environment and conflicts: the Environment as basis for conflicts.The course provides a continuation of the masters course GEOG 3515 Environment, Development and Changing Rural Livelihoods. \r\n\r\nGEOG8515 is a reading course and the reading list will be decided upon individually. The paper can be handed in, in either English or Norwegian."},{"code":"KURSMAT","name":"Kursmateriell"},{"code":"L\u00c6RFORM","name":"L\u00e6ringsformer og aktiviteter","text":"Paper."},{"code":"M\u00c5L","name":"L\u00e6ringsm\u00e5l","text":"The course provides candidates with high competence on the relationship between environment development and livelihoods in rural societies in Africa and Asia.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t"}],"assessment":[{"code":"O","codeName":"Oppgave","combinationCode":"O","combinationName":"Oppgave","firstExecutionYear":2012,"firstExecutionTerm":"Autumn","realExecutionYear":2012,"realExecutionTerm":"Autumn","statusCode":"ORD","statusName":"Ordin\u00e6r eksamen","gradeWeightingNumerator":100,"gradeWeightingDenominator":100,"duration":0,"deadlineBackOut":"2012-11-15","assessmentFormCode":"O","assessmentFormDescription":"Oppgave","assessmentTimeCode":"12","partNr":1,"registrationDeadline":"2012-09-15","gradeRuleScheme":"4","gradeRuleSchemeName":"Best\u00e5tt\/Ikke best\u00e5tt","gradeRuleUnit":"4","gradeRuleUnitName":"Best\u00e5tt\/Ikke best\u00e5tt"}],"educationLanguage":[{"code":"ENGELSK","name":"Engelsk","norwegianName":"Engelsk","englishName":"English"}],"educationalRole":[{"code":"Coordinator","name":"Koordinator","term":"Autumn","personId":511189,"person":{"personId":511189,"dateOfBirth":null,"gender":"Male","firstName":"Haakon","lastName":"Lein","displayName":"Haakon Lein","email":"haakon.lein@svt.ntnu.no","publicationStatus":"NotReserved","username":"haakon","officeAddress":"Bygg 7*7408, Dragvoll, Edvard Bulls veg 1","phone":"73591913","mobilePhone":"91897634","employee":true,"affiliated":false,"student":false}}],"educationTerm":[{"termNum":1,"startTerm":"Autumn","termApplies":"Autumn","year":2012,"yearIncrement":0,"registrationDeadline":"2012-09-15","numOfRegistratedStudents":0}],"subjectArea":[{"code":"GEOGRAFI","name":"Geografi","norwegianName":"Geografi","newNorwegianName":"Geografi","englishName":"Geography"}],"usedInStudyprogrammes":[{"code":"PHGEOG","name":"Geografi","englishName":"Geography","statusUseCourseProgrammeConnectionInReporting":true,"statusPublishCourseInfoAsPartOfStudyProgramme":true,"requireSelectedInEducationPlan":false}]},"cache":{"updated":"2012-10-27T19:36:09+02:00","expires":"2012-11-03T18:36:09+01:00"},"request":{"courseCode":"geog8515","year":"2012","term":"autumn","language":"no"}}
