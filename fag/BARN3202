The course also aims to offer students the possibility to write brief academic texts. \r\n\r\nBy the end of the course participants will have gained an understanding of:\r\n* Theory of science: knowledge about different research paradigms, and theoretical perspectives related to empirical research on children and childhood as a social phenomenon and interpretive methodologies. \r\n* Reflexivity: through empirical examples, student activities and discussions, to reflect upon the relationship between overall scientific principles, perspectives and debates, as well as on issues to consider when preparing a research plan.\r\n* Academic writing: knowledge about expectations regarding an academic text through lectures, individual writing and group discussions."},{"code":"INNHOLD","name":"Faglig innhold","text":"The course will provide an overview of different scientific paradigms and perspectives, focus specifically on ethnographic approaches and discuss how a focus on children as subjects in research influences the various steps in a research process, such as formulating a research question, preparing an empirical inquiry, obtaining access to the field, ethics, collecting data, analysis and interpretation of data, and drawing up a research text. This approach and content aim to develop students' reflexivity and qualify them to make informed decisions when planning an inquiry. The course will also focus theoretically and practically on academic writing. The lectures will draw on ongoing empirical research based at the centre as well as from the international milieu of children and childhood researchers."},{"code":"KURSMAT","name":"Kursmateriell","text":"Information will be given at the beginning of the semester."},{"code":"L\u00c6RFORM","name":"L\u00e6ringsformer og aktiviteter","text":"Total lecture hours: ca. 20 hours, total seminar hours: up to 12 hours, with presentation and discussion of individual students' working papers.
