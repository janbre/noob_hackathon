The possibilities and limitations related to the use of different methods will be addressed. Children's perspectives within research involve the exploration of children's everyday lives from children's perspectives and experiences. A grassroot's perspective such as this entails a methodological approach towards children as informants in the research process and calls for the use of a variety of methods. These may include various forms of interviews, observations, visual methods and fieldwork. Methodological issues such as accessing children as informants and research ethics will be addressed. In addition, discourse analysis of texts, documents and social practices will be included. Though the main emphasis is on qualitative research, various quantitative methods and the combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches will be addressed. Lectures draw on ongoing empirical research based at the centre as well as from an international milieu of children and childhood researchers.
