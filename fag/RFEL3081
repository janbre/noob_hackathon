This is a course in which the students with different disciplinary and cultural backgrounds apply their academic competence in interdisciplinary project work to learn teamwork skills to prepare them for working life with specific focus on issues in natural resources management. The issues will deal with disciplines within biology, geology, geography, environmental chemistry and energy resources integrated with socio-economic aspects. Typically, a project focus on challenges related to sustainable management of a specified natural resource. Furthermore, to assess the consequences of different management strategies, the conflicts of interests among stakeholders and the socioeconomic aspects at different levels. Through the semester the project groups will develop a multidisciplinary report within the focal subject. \r\nAn objective of the course is to increase insight into the distinctive characteristics of other academic disciplines and their ways of working. At the same time, the course is intended to strengthen the students' own academic identity, through the interaction in the team and the way in which their academic competence contributes to the project. Through team-based reflection, the students at the master programme will gain increased insight into patterns of behaviour and approaches (\"ways of being\") that are required to achieve positive results in interdisciplinary project work.\r\n"},{"code":"KURSMAT","name":"Kursmateriell","text":"To be announced."},{"code":"L\u00c6RFORM","name":"L\u00e6ringsformer og aktiviteter","text":"Seminars,
