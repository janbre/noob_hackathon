Comparative analyses of Norway within other national and international settings will also be addressed.\r\n\r\nA central theme throughout is the concept of the \u0093Scandinavian Model\u0094 or \u0093Nordic Model\u0094, which refers to the combination of a market-based economy with a substantial welfare State and an emphasis on participative democracy and equality goals across social dividing lines such as gender and class. The course both explains this model and critiques exaggerated claims as to its realization.\r\n\r\nThis course is primarily intended for foreign exchange students, and the lectures and assignments are given in English. The course will only be offered when there are at least 5 exchange students who wish to take it. The course is only offered in the fall.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this course cannot be included in the major in Sociology.
