Core elements are on collision and grounding avoidance at sea, ship weather routing and assessment of ship-handling difficulties in congested and topographically restricted waterways.\r\n\r\nShip-to-ship operations are emphasized with a focus on the maneuvering challenges in approaching another vessel in open waters for cargo transfer. The interaction effect and technological solutions that can provide adequate decision-support to the officer in charge are highlighted. \r\n"},{"code":"KURSMAT","name":"Kursmateriell","text":"Compendium, lecture notes, technical\/scientific papers."},{"code":"L\u00c6RFORM","name":"L\u00e6ringsformer og aktiviteter","text":"Lectures and compulsory exercises.
