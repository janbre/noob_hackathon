Students must attend an obligatory master's thesis seminar within the programme. This seminar is meant to prepare the student for working with the thesis. The supervisor, other teachers attached to the programme, as well as other students are also invited to attend the seminar which is arranged early in the 3rd semester of the master programme. Student presentations and plans for their theses, discussions involving methodological design, strategies regarding practical aspects in the writing and structuring of the thesis, relevant ethical standards and research ethics are central elements in the seminar.  Participation in the master seminar must be approved before the thesis can be submitted. It is possible to apply for an exemption regarding the seminar participation if the student is accepted at a university abroad during this semester. In such a case, the student must come up with a written outline of the thesis (exhausive) before the end of the 3rd semester (1st of December). It is highly recommended that the topic of the master's thesis is chosen from the speciality area of the student. It should result in a presentation of a scientific study (empirical or theorethical)which may well be related to earlier courses or independent tasks. There are certain rules for the structuring of the master's thesis, and of criteria connected to the evaluation. These can be obtained from the Department of Psychology. The choice of theme and of the specific problem area of the master's thesis are expected to be a result of discussions with the supervisor. Supervision is therefore an essential component. Supervision is a necessary instrument of quality assurance in the work with collection and analysis of data, as well as a guarantee that the work is performed within approved ethical standards of scientific research.  A Master agreement must be signed before the supervision take place. \r\n"},{"code":"KURSMAT","name":"Kursmateriell","text":"Individually selected."},{"code":"L\u00c6RFORM","name":"L\u00e6ringsformer og aktiviteter","text":"Admission to Mphil Programme in Risk Rsychology, Environment and Safety is required.
