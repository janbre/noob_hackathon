This includes, among others, the adoption of a developmental approach, as well as viewing childhood as socially constructed. The course addresses issues at a structural level, that have implications for children's everyday lives and childhood, as well as children's active contribution and agency in defining and giving meaning to their lives, activities and relations. Central issues to explore in this course are images and understandings of children and childhood, generation, culture, gender, identity, ethnicity, children's lived experiences in relation to peer activities and adult organization, and their expectations in and outside educational institutions. The course also addresses childhood as a social phenomenon and shows how children are both shaped by and themselves shape their childhood experiences within diverse societal and daily life conditions, practices, power and generational relations."},{"code":"KURSMAT","name":"Kursmateriell","text":"Information will be given at the beginning of the semester."},{"code":"L\u00c6RFORM","name":"L\u00e6ringsformer og aktiviteter","text":"Total lecture hours: ca. 20 hours.\r\n"},{"code":"M\u00c5L","name":"L\u00e6ringsm\u00e5l","text":"This course aims to introduce students to theoretical concepts and ongoing debates in social studies of children and childhood, as well as to how children's everyday lives and welfare and the politics of childhood vary across time and space. \r\n\r\nBy the end of the course participants will have gained an understanding of:\r\n* The interdisciplinary social studies of children and childhood, the historical background, concepts and contemporary perspectives, and debates on and critique of the approach. \r\n* Childhood as a social, cultural and historical phenomenon, children's everyday lives and wellbeing as well as politics of childhood in changing societies."}],"assessment":[{"code":"S","codeName":"Skriftlig","combinationCode":"S1","combinationName":"Skriftlig","firstExecutionYear":2012,"firstExecutionTerm":"Autumn","realExecutionYear":2012,"realExecutionTerm":"Autumn","date":"2012-12-07","appearanceTime":"09:00","statusCode":"ORD","statusName":"Ordin\u00e6r eksamen","gradeWeightingNumerator":100,"gradeWeightingDenominator":100,"duration":4,"deadlineBackOut":"2012-11-15","assessmentFormCode":"S","assessmentFormDescription":"Skriftlig eksamen","assessmentTimeCode":"12","partNr":1,"registrationDeadline":"2012-09-15","gradeRuleScheme":"30","gradeRuleSchemeName":"Bokstavkarakterer","gradeRuleUnit":"30","gradeRuleUnitName":"Bokstavkarakterer"},{"code":"S","codeName":"Skriftlig","combinationCode":"S1","combinationName":"Skriftlig","firstExecutionYear":2013,"firstExecutionTerm":"Spring","realExecutionYear":2013,"realExecutionTerm":"Spring","date":"2013-05-22","appearanceTime":"09:00","statusCode":"ORD","statusName":"Ordin\u00e6r eksamen","gradeWeightingNumerator":100,"gradeWeightingDenominator":100,"duration":4,"deadlineBackOut":"2013-04-30","assessmentFormCode":"S","assessmentFormDescription":"Skriftlig eksamen","assessmentTimeCode":"06","partNr":1,"registrationDeadline":"2013-02-15","gradeRuleScheme":"30","gradeRuleSchemeName":"Bokstavkarakterer","gradeRuleUnit":"30","gradeRuleUnitName":"Bokstavkarakterer"}],"educationLanguage":[{"code":"ENGELSK","name":"Engelsk","norwegianName":"Engelsk","englishName":"English"}],"educationTerm":[{"termNum":1,"startTerm":"Autumn","termApplies":"Autumn","year":2012,"yearIncrement":0,"registrationDeadline":"2012-09-15","numOfRegistratedStudents":30}],"mandatoryActivity":[{"number":1,"name":"Attending lectures is compulsory (minimum 80%)"}],"subjectArea":[{"code":"11229","name":"Barndomsstudier","norwegianName":"Barndomsstudier","newNorwegianName":"Barndomsstudier","englishName":"Childhood Studies"},{"code":"SAMVIT","name":"Samfunnsvitenskapelige fag","norwegianName":"Samfunnsvitenskapelige fag","newNorwegianName":"Samfunnsvitskaplege fag","englishName":"Social Sciences"}],"creditReduction":[{"courseCode":"BARN3001","weightRuleCode":4166,"creditsReduction":7.5,"creditsTypeReduction":"SP","ruleTypeCode":"ORD","fromDate":"2006-08-01"},{"courseCode":"BARN3100","weightRuleCode":4164,"creditsReduction":7.5,"creditsTypeReduction":"SP","ruleTypeCode":"ORD","fromDate":"2006-08-01"}],"usedInStudyprogrammes":[{"code":"MPCHILD","name":"Childhood Studies","englishName":"Childhood Studies","statusUseCourseProgrammeConnectionInReporting":true,"statusPublishCourseInfoAsPartOfStudyProgramme":true,"requireSelectedInEducationPlan":false}]},"cache":{"updated":"2012-10-27T19:35:23+02:00","expires":"2012-11-03T18:35:23+01:00"},"request":{"courseCode":"barn3101","year":"2012","term":"autumn","language":"no"}}
