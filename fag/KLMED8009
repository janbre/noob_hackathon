This course will cover all aspects of RCTs, from design to reporting. Particular emphasis will be placed upon practical aspects. Recent advances in RCT methodology will be covered, including data monitoring committees (DMCs), stopping rules, Independent  ethics committee procedures (IECs), good clinical practice (GCP is increasingly demanded as a standard by the European Union), and reporting of trials (Revised CONSORT Statement).\r\n \r\n\u0095 Background, including non-randomized studies and historical controls. Controlled trials; placebos; double blind; multicentre trials; phase I, II, III IV trials; cross-over trials; equivalence trials. \r\n\r\n\u0095 Randomization, and how to implement it; cases of failed randomization; is randomization ethical? The uncertainty principle. Patient consent. \r\n\u0095 Protocol design: Background, eligibility criteria, randomization, sample size, outcome measures, procedures for participants, monitoring, reporting and analysis, publication policy. \r\n\u0095 Form design and layout (CRF, Case Report Form). \r\n\u0095 Basic statistics: Significance tests, confidence intervals and p-values. \r\n\u0095 Sample size estimation: Methods and application, demonstration of a data program\r\n\u0095 Approval and procedures: Writing committees, protocol review procedures, ethical approval (IRB), Data Monitoring Committees (DMC). \r\n\u0095 Statistical aspects of data monitoring: Data monitoring - role and methods, recruitment charts, interim analyses, stopping rules and examples of trials which were stopped prematurely. Bayesian monitoring. \r\n\u0095 Organizational aspects: Multicentre trials; structure of trials offices; training of staff; launch of trials; data entry; data management; monitoring procedures; data checking - double data entry. \r\n\u0095 Analysis: Patient exclusions, intention to treat analysis, pragmatic or exploratory analyses, data checking, significance tests, equivalence trials and multiple endpoints. \r\n\u0095 Conflicts of interest. Fraud, bias and confounding. \r\n\u0095 Reporting: Eligibility, patient exclusions, standard journal requirements, reporting randomization procedures, interpreting significance, clinically significant effects, confirmatory trials, BMJ checklist. \r\n\r\nThe second part of the course (3 days) covers the use of clinical measurements and studies on diagnostic tests, including precision, accuracy, validity, specificity, sensitivity, reproducibility, feasibility, appropriateness and how to interpret the results in a clinical setting. How to design, use, analyse and interpret the results from cross-sectional-, case-control-, and cohort studies; and the strengths and limits of these designs in a clinical setting. How to establish, maintain and use clinical registers and databases and to differentiate such registers from epidemiological\/population based surveys and data in medical records.\r\nFurther, this part of the course will focus on Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO). Worldwide there is an increasing demand to always consider measurements of PRO in new clinical trials. Measurements of PRO and subjective symptoms are generally important, but particularly important in studies of palliative care. The results of such measurements are gaining interest as a secondary endpoint in studies where the aim is to decrease morbidity or mortality in severe and\/or chronic illnesses. \r\nThe course will cover several aspects of these measurements in randomized studies and clinical trials; choice of questionnaire, methods, study design, problem solving, analysis and comprehension of the data, report of results and conclusions.\r\n"},{"code":"KURSMAT","name":"Kursmateriell","text":"Stephen B Hulley et al.
