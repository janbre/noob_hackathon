They learn how to discuss the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and its implications for children's lives in different parts of the world. The students will learn to explore children's lives and welfare in light of changing policies and processes of globalization. The students acquire knowledge about the principle of the 'best interest of the child' and children's rights to provision, protection and participation. Among additional topics to be addressed are emerging issues on the rights of minority-group children (e.g. the rights of street children, the rights of refugee children etc.), children as social participants in the economic, social and cultural reproduction of society, the role of NGOs in the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, assessments of national reports on children's rights, migration and ethnicity, etc. Through nuanced discussion, the course also provides students with knowledge about the competing discourses on children as autonomous beings or as dependent social becomings."},{"code":"KURSMAT","name":"Kursmateriell","text":"Information will be given at the beginning of the semester."},{"code":"L\u00c6RFORM","name":"L\u00e6ringsformer og aktiviteter","text":"Total lecture hours: ca. 18 hours, total seminar hours: up to 12 hours.
