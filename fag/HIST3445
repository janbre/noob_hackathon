Questions to be addressed are, for instance: Was the significant reduction of German unemployment during the first years of the Nazi rule, which heavily legitimized the Nazi regime in the eyes of the Germans, predominately caused by measures implemented by the new government or was this reduction merely a coincidence with the worldwide economic recovery? How did the Nazi regime transform the German economy from a peace to a war economy - by force, by incentives or by regulations? And how did the Nazis exploit occupied Europe and which impact had the foreign contribution to the German war effort?"},{"code":"M\u00c5L","name":"L\u00e6ringsm\u00e5l","text":"A candidate who passes this course is expected to have the following learning outcome according to the course curriculum, defined as knowledge and skills:\r\n\r\nKnowledge:\r\nCandidate\r\n- will acquire a broad knowledge base about European colonial expansion and imperialism, and the impact on international and global transformations\r\n- will acquire an understanding of how colonized peoples engaged and managed their colonial situation\r\n- will acquire an insight into the historiography of colonial history in particular, and the history of globalization in general\r\n- will acquire the ability to apply theories and perspectives used to analyze colonial history in general, and in the context of international developments and globalization\r\n\r\nSkills:\r\nCandidate\r\n- should be able to critically interrogate the concepts, theoretical assumptions and established perspectives of the field\r\n- should be able to write an extended independent, well-structured analytical essay\/paper, using the relevant empirical knowledge and theoretical perspectives of the field\r\n- should be able to give an oral presentation on a chosen topic\/theme during lecture\/seminar sessions\r\n- should be able to locate colonial history within a context of broader global historical changes"},{"code":"KURSMAT","name":"Kursmateriell","text":"Lectures and seminars."},{"code":"L\u00c6RFORM","name":"L\u00e6ringsformer og aktiviteter","text":"Lectures and seminars.
