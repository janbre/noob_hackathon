This\r\ncourse will provide an overview about globalization and\r\nde-globalization during the last 150 years. It will especially try to\r\nanswer the following questions: How did economic globalization develop\r\nand what different periods can be observed? What are the specific\r\ncharacteristics of these periods? Which factors caused globalization?\r\nWhich conditions favored or hampered its development? What effects did\r\nglobalization have in different respects? And what repercussions, in\r\nturn, did these effects have on the further development of\r\nglobalization? We will further discuss, based on country case studies,\r\nwhy the economic effects of globalization and the reactions to\r\nglobalization differed among different countries.\r\n"},{"code":"KURSMAT","name":"Kursmateriell"},{"code":"L\u00c6RFORM","name":"L\u00e6ringsformer og aktiviteter","text":"Lectures and seminars."},{"code":"M\u00c5L","name":"L\u00e6ringsm\u00e5l","text":"A candidate who passes this course is expected to have the following learning outcome according to the course curriculum, defined as knowledge and skills:\r\n\r\nKnowledge:\r\nCandidate\r\n- should especially get an overview about periods of economic globalization and of economic de-globalization during the last 150 years as well as about their characteristics \r\n- should learn to identify the factors causing these developments and to analyze and describe \u0096 from different perspectives and based on different country case studies \u0096 both the direct effects and\r\n- repercussions of economic globalization and of economic de-globalization\r\n- should learn to interpret and to contextualize historical statistics\r\n\r\nSkills:\r\nCandidate\r\n- should learn to write and to structure a short essay in a proper way as well as to find sources and literature. \r\n- should get good knowledge about the history of globalization and about the basics of development theories and trade theory\r\n"}],"assessment":[{"code":"H","codeName":"Hjemmeeksamen","combinationCode":"H","combinationName":"Hjemmeeks","firstExecutionYear":2012,"firstExecutionTerm":"Autumn","realExecutionYear":2012,"realExecutionTerm":"Autumn","statusCode":"ORD","statusName":"Ordin\u00e6r eksamen","gradeWeightingNumerator":100,"gradeWeightingDenominator":100,"duration":0,"deadlineBackOut":"2012-11-15","assessmentFormCode":"H","assessmentFormDescription":"Hjemmeeksamen","assessmentTimeCode":"12","partNr":1,"registrationDeadline":"2012-09-15","gradeRuleScheme":"30","gradeRuleSchemeName":"Bokstavkarakterer","gradeRuleUnit":"30","gradeRuleUnitName":"Bokstavkarakterer"}],"educationLanguage":[{"code":"ENGELSK","name":"Engelsk","norwegianName":"Engelsk","englishName":"English"}],"educationalRole":[{"code":"Coordinator","name":"Koordinator","term":"Autumn","personId":655601,"person":{"personId":655601,"dateOfBirth":null,"gender":"Male","firstName":"Jonas","lastName":"Scherner","displayName":"Jonas Scherner","email":"jonas.scherner@ntnu.no","publicationStatus":"NotReserved","username":"jonassc","officeAddress":"Paviljong Fotballbanen*220B, Dragvoll, Loholt all\u00e9 91","phone":"73596453","employee":true,"affiliated":false,"student":true}}],"educationTerm":[{"termNum":1,"startTerm":"Autumn","termApplies":"Autumn","year":2012,"yearIncrement":0,"lectureHours":2,"registrationDeadline":"2012-09-15","numOfRegistratedStudents":46}],"mandatoryActivity":[{"number":1,"name":"Godkjent seminarinnlegg\/semesteroppgave"}],"subjectArea":[{"code":"HISTORIE","name":"Historie","norwegianName":"Historie","newNorwegianName":"Historie","englishName":"History"}],"usedInStudyprogrammes":[{"code":"MHIST","name":"Historie","englishName":"History","statusUseCourseProgrammeConnectionInReporting":true,"statusPublishCourseInfoAsPartOfStudyProgramme":true,"requireSelectedInEducationPlan":false}]},"cache":{"updated":"2012-10-27T19:52:45+02:00","expires":"2012-11-03T18:52:45+01:00"},"request":{"courseCode":"hist3295","year":"2012","term":"autumn","language":"no"}}
