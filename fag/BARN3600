The course will study such cultural representations in relation to different ideas of children and childhood as well as to children's lives. Both in present time and historically one can observe diverse images like the 'innocent child', 'the natural child', 'the evil child', 'the piteous child' and 'the competent child'. Such images and diverse cultural representations influence understandings of childhood. The significance and possible consequences for children's wellbeing, politics and social practices concerning children and childhood will be discussed.  \r\nFurther, the course will elaborate on children's activities and lived life in a contemporary context, at childhood places like kindergarten and primary school, home, family and peer settings. How children contribute to shape their own and other's everyday lives as well as adult structuring and control of children's activities, time and space will be addressed. The course will illustrate daily life and cultural practices among children, and how they negotiate, learn and question adult practices, caring, routines and rules that create possibilities and constraints for children.\r\nThe different substantial issues of children and childhood that are addressed in the course relate to processes that can be conceptualised as cultural (re)production, and socialisation. Further, age, generation, gender, ethnicity and disability are interwoven in constructions of child(hood) identities, children's lives and cultural representations.   \r\nRelevant theories and key concepts that relate to Social studies of children and childhood will be applied and discussed, and the course includes knowledge from research that is carried out at the Norwegian Centre for Child Research and beyond. \r\nKey concepts include: Culture, child(hood) representations, social identities, gender, minority \u0096 majority relations, normativity, discourse, child-child and adult-child practices and relations, agency, resistance, power and control, everyday life, institutionalisation and familialisation of childhood."},{"code":"KURSMAT","name":"Kursmateriell","text":"Information will be given at the beginning of the semester."},{"code":"L\u00c6RFORM","name":"L\u00e6ringsformer og aktiviteter","text":"Lectures, seminars and student organized group work.
