The course will focus on three areas: 1) the nature of mechanisms in neuroscience; 2) the nature of biological emergence and complexity; and 3) the neurobiological basis of the self.\r\nThese areas, not independent of each other, will be investigated through different accounts of the relationship between cognitive phenomena such as perception and memory and the neural mechanisms underpinning such mental functions. This problem, however, is just a part of the more general problem of relating the mind to the brain. How are we to link molecules to mind? Can the mind be wholly decomposed to neural signalling and interacting molecules? Or is the way cells and molecules are organized in circuits, tissues and organs causally and explanatory essential? Perhaps a plausible account of the mind\/brain nexus must, explain how mental phenomena are enabled by \u0091lower level\u0092 mechanisms, and how emergent \u0091higher-level\u0092 structures and processes at the system level can influence their component parts. In short, examining the nature of neural mechanisms and the way these mechanisms are organized in nervous systems may shed light on the fundamental nature of the self, consciousness and the will.\r\n"},{"code":"KURSMAT","name":"Kursmateriell","text":"In addition to common reading material, students are required to compose their own reading list in consultation with lecturer."},{"code":"L\u00c6RFORM","name":"L\u00e6ringsformer og aktiviteter","text":"Lectures, supervision and self-study.
