This includes, among others, the adoption of a developmental approach, as well as viewing childhood as socially constructed. The course addresses issues at a structural level, that have implications for children's everyday lives and childhood, as well as children's active contribution and agency in defining and giving meaning to their lives, activities and relations. Central issues to explore in this course are images and understandings of children and childhood, generation, culture, gender, identity, ethnicity, children's lived experiences in relation to peer activities and adult organization, and their expectations in and outside educational institutions. The course also addresses childhood as a social phenomenon and shows how children are both shaped by and themselves shape their childhood experiences within diverse societal and daily life conditions, practices, power and generational relations."},{"code":"KURSMAT","name":"Kursmateriell","text":"Information will be given at the beginning of the semester."},{"code":"L\u00c6RFORM","name":"L\u00e6ringsformer og aktiviteter","text":"Total lecture hours: ca. 20.
