Power electronics is one candidate solution provided that use of the device is done on the basis of a proper understanding of the complex problem. The aim of the course is to provide a theoretical platform for developing a solid criteria for instantaneous compensation of the non active component of the power in the context of the power theory debate still open today. \r\nSyllabus: \r\nIntroduction- Historical review of the reactive power theory for non sinusoidal\/unbalanced conditions. Presentation of the updated discussion in the scientific community. \r\n\r\nImportance of reactive power control in electric power systems. Advantages and disadvantages of different types or reactive power compensation systems: passive\/active, fixed\/regulated series\/shunt compensations.\r\n\r\nPrinciple of Reactive Power control.  General capabilities of voltage source converters for instantaneous compensation. Evaluation of distributed versus centralized compensation. \r\n\r\nDiscussion of the following reactive power comensating devices:\r\n- Static Var Compensator(SVC): Principle of operation, configuration and control capabilities \r\n\r\n\u0096 Static Compensator(STATCOM): Principle of operation, configuration and control capabilities\r\n\r\nStability Issues: control of power electronics and stability investigation. \r\n"},{"code":"KURSMAT","name":"Kursmateriell","text":"The two following books will be used as reference for discussions and fundamental definitions.
