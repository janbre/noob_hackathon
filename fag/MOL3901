The thesis should have a scientific composition and be founded on applicable theory and literature within the specific subject. Current topics could be molecular mechanisms and epidemiological causes, diagnostic problems and therapeutic measures. It is a great advantage that the thesis is connected to the existing research activities at the Faculty of Medicine. The principal supervisor is chosen among the scientific staff with permanent positions. The thesis should be a monograph or a scientific paper with concluding remarks. In both cases, the student should document a theoretical comprehension and a broad understanding of the methods that have been used.\r\n\r\nStudents enrolled in the master's programme in 2007 or earlier can write the thesis in Norwegian or English.
