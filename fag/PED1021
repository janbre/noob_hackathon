Over time knowledge has proven to be a two-edged sword of both a social scientific mastery as enlightenment and of social regulation and control of agents within educational institutions. The course outlines and explores this contradiction and points out consequences and educational possibilities keeping this contradiction in mind. It implies a basic focus on micro interactions in pedagogical settings and what they owe to their overall conditions: historical inheritance, bodily and social experiences, cultural diversity as well as series of macro level conditions. Pedagogical practices in formal, informal and non-formal education will be considered as well as the relationship between them. Basic theories on education will be attributed to empirical research on educational practices and on socialization.\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"code":"KURSMAT","name":"Kursmateriell","text":"The reading list for the course counts around 500 pages of which until 100 pages are to be selected by the student.
