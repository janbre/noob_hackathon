Thus, the course will cover the linkages from definition of the problem and pre-fieldwork preparation, to fieldwork strategies and dilemmas, to analising data and preparation of the finished text. It will also include an introduction to a range of software tools available for data collection, analysis, and manuscript preparation. \r\nParticipants will be expected to submit a draft of their proposed research. This will allow proposals to be pre-circulated to and read by participants prior to the workshop. Participants will also be given the opportunity to present their proposals at the workshop. \r\nThere is no course fee, however participants are expected to cover their own travel and accommodation expenses. Vacancies are limited, so early registration is highly recommended. The course is equivalent to 10 ECTS.
