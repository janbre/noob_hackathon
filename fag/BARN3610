As part of this, the study will focus on the enormous cultural diversity in children's lived experiences, as well as on how local categories, notions, and values may influence parents and community members' perceptions and choices with respect to the caretaking of young children. The course will enable students to question some assumptions to what are \"normal\" and \"natural\" ways to see and understand young children. The course mainly covers studies from anthropological, qualitative research traditions."},{"code":"KURSMAT","name":"Kursmateriell","text":"Information will be given at the beginning of the semester."},{"code":"L\u00c6RFORM","name":"L\u00e6ringsformer og aktiviteter","text":"Total lecture hours: ca. 20 hours, total seminar hours: up to 12 hours.
