Candidates who did not study this subject should follow the lectures and study the readings for this course. The lectures\/seminars in the master course GEOG3522 will be given in Norwegian. As in GEOG3522, this course discusses internal and international migration processes in a development context. In particular the course concentrates on understanding the relationship between migration and development by offering theoretical insights into how to conceptualise migration and how development theories have understood the role of migration in development. The course aims to provide analytical approaches for understanding the migration process by introducing debates on causes, practices, migration regimes and policies, as well as the development impacts of internal and international migration. Methodological approaches for researching migration and development will be introduced. GEOG8522 is a reading course and the reading list will be decided upon individually. The paper can be handed in, in either English or Norwegian."},{"code":"KURSMAT","name":"Kursmateriell"},{"code":"L\u00c6RFORM","name":"L\u00e6ringsformer og aktiviteter","text":"Paper"},{"code":"M\u00c5L","name":"L\u00e6ringsm\u00e5l","text":"On completion of this course students should be able to show a critical understanding of:\r\n\u0095\tTheories of migration and development, their position in and relationship with Geography and cognate social sciences disciplines\r\n\u0095\tHow to apply theories of migration and development in empirical research.\r\n\u0095\tMethodological approaches and principles of research on migration and development\r\n"}],"assessment":[{"code":"O","codeName":"Oppgave","combinationCode":"O1","combinationName":"Oppgave","firstExecutionYear":2013,"firstExecutionTerm":"Spring","realExecutionYear":2013,"realExecutionTerm":"Spring","statusCode":"ORD","statusName":"Ordin\u00e6r eksamen","gradeWeightingNumerator":100,"gradeWeightingDenominator":100,"duration":0,"deadlineBackOut":"2013-04-30","assessmentFormCode":"O","assessmentFormDescription":"Oppgave","assessmentTimeCode":"06","partNr":1,"registrationDeadline":"2013-02-15","gradeRuleScheme":"4","gradeRuleSchemeName":"Best\u00e5tt\/Ikke best\u00e5tt","gradeRuleUnit":"4","gradeRuleUnitName":"Best\u00e5tt\/Ikke best\u00e5tt"}],"educationLanguage":[{"code":"ENGELSK","name":"Engelsk","norwegianName":"Engelsk","englishName":"English"}],"educationalRole":[{"code":"SubjectLecturer","name":"Fagl\u00e6rer","term":"Spring","personId":505315,"person":{"personId":505315,"dateOfBirth":null,"gender":"Female","firstName":"Cathrine","lastName":"Brun","displayName":"Cathrine Brun","email":"cathrine.brun@svt.ntnu.no","publicationStatus":"NotReserved","username":"cathribr","officeAddress":"Bygg 7*7481, Dragvoll, Edvard Bulls veg 1","phone":"73550246","employee":true,"affiliated":false,"student":false}},{"code":"Coordinator","name":"Koordinator","term":"Spring","personId":505315,"person":{"personId":505315,"dateOfBirth":null,"gender":"Female","firstName":"Cathrine","lastName":"Brun","displayName":"Cathrine Brun","email":"cathrine.brun@svt.ntnu.no","publicationStatus":"NotReserved","username":"cathribr","officeAddress":"Bygg 7*7481, Dragvoll, Edvard Bulls veg 1","phone":"73550246","employee":true,"affiliated":false,"student":false}}],"educationTerm":[{"termNum":1,"startTerm":"Spring","termApplies":"Spring","year":2013,"yearIncrement":0,"registrationDeadline":"2013-02-15","numOfRegistratedStudents":0}],"subjectArea":[{"code":"GEOGRAFI","name":"Geografi","norwegianName":"Geografi","newNorwegianName":"Geografi","englishName":"Geography"},{"code":"SAMVIT","name":"Samfunnsvitenskapelige fag","norwegianName":"Samfunnsvitenskapelige fag","newNorwegianName":"Samfunnsvitskaplege fag","englishName":"Social Sciences"}],"usedInStudyprogrammes":[{"code":"MAFR","name":"Afrikastudier","englishName":"African Studies","statusUseCourseProgrammeConnectionInReporting":true,"statusPublishCourseInfoAsPartOfStudyProgramme":true,"requireSelectedInEducationPlan":false},{"code":"MPSVDEV","name":"Development Studies","englishName":"Development Studies","statusUseCourseProgrammeConnectionInReporting":true,"statusPublishCourseInfoAsPartOfStudyProgramme":true,"requireSelectedInEducationPlan":false},{"code":"PHGEOG","name":"Geografi","englishName":"Geography","statusUseCourseProgrammeConnectionInReporting":true,"statusPublishCourseInfoAsPartOfStudyProgramme":true,"requireSelectedInEducationPlan":false}]},"cache":{"updated":"2012-10-27T19:41:03+02:00","expires":"2012-11-03T18:41:03+01:00"},"request":{"courseCode":"geog8522","year":"2012","term":"autumn","language":"no"}}
