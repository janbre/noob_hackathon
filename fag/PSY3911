The choice of theme, and specific focus, of the master's thesis are expected to be a result of discussions with the supervisor(s). Students must also attend and present their work at an obligatory master's thesis seminar. This seminar is meant to prepare the student for further work with the thesis. The supervisor(s), other teachers attached to the collaboration between Industrial Ecology and RIPENSA, as well as students in the relevant programmes attend such seminars, which are arranged in the 3rd semester of the master programme. Student presentations involve an outlining of plans for the overall theses work, literature choices, methodological design, strategies regarding practical aspects in the writing and structuring of the thesis, and considerations of ethical standards and research ethics. Participation in the master seminar, and an approval of the presented content, are required before the thesis can be submitted. It is possible to apply for an exemption regarding the seminar participation if the student is accepted at a university abroad during the 3rd semester. In such a case, the student must present the full task in writing before the end of the 3rd semester (1st of December). It is highly recommended that the topic of the master's thesis is chosen from the speciality area resulting from the course choices and interests of the student as long as adequate supervision can be guaranteed. The thesis should result in a scientific study, based on either empirical or theoretical work. The rules for structuring and contents of the master's thesis, and of criteria connected to the evaluation can be obtained from the Department of Psychology. Supervision is a necessary instrument of quality assurance in the work with collection and analysis of data, as well as a guarantee that the work is performed within approved ethical standards of scientific research. The Department of Psychology approves the topic of the thesis, and appoints the main supervisor. The deadline for the applications of approval of chosen topic and of the appointment of the supervisor, is announced by the Department of Psychology, which also provide applicatien forms."},{"code":"KURSMAT","name":"Kursmateriell","text":"Individually selected."},{"code":"L\u00c6RFORM","name":"L\u00e6ringsformer og aktiviteter","text":"Admission to Master of Science Programme in Industrial Ecology and passed examination in PSY3090.\r\n\r\nIndividual studies in relation to supervision; participation in seminars.\r\n \r\nForms of evaluations and examination: The master's thesis can be presented in the form of a monography or in the form of 1-2 separate papers and a summary.
