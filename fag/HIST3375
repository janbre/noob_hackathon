This approximate periodization covers the phase of European expansion and global reach that is often referred to as \u0091new imperialism\u0092. \r\n\r\nThe methodological approach will be comparative; and the geographical focus will be Asia and Africa (but references may also be made to the Americas and \u0091neo-Europes\u0092 elsewhere). \r\n\r\nIn general, the course will cover two broad alternative thematic areas: (a) European imperialist expansion and colonialism, 1850-1960 and\/or (b) decolonization (the dismantling of colonial empires). This means that the course may focus on one of the two thematic area from year to year.\r\n\r\nThematically, the course will be organized as follows:\r\n- Concepts, Theories, Historiography\r\n- Dynamics of Global Dominance (Empirical): European (Britain, France, Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, Portucal, italy, etc)colonial expansion in Asia and Africa (The colonial project: motives, nature, and impact)\r\n- Decentring empire: India and the Indian Ocean Arena as peripheral metropoles\r\n- Colonialism, Internationalism, and Globalization\r\n- Decolonization: decline and dismantling of colonial empire"},{"code":"KURSMAT","name":"Kursmateriell","text":"See reading list:\r\n\r\n"},{"code":"L\u00c6RFORM","name":"L\u00e6ringsformer og aktiviteter","text":"Lectures and seminars.
