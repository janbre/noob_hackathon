This is accompanied by a week-long training workshop that involves hands-on experience on engaging children and young people in different stages of the research process. The training workshop draws on a manual for participatory approaches and gives students the opportunity to develop a repertoire of methods and ethical strategy by means of concrete examples, as well as plenary and group discussions. Additional lectures will be given by lecturers undertaking empirical studies with children in different parts of the world in order to exemplify the diversity and complexity of child-focused methods and ethics.\r\n\r\nStudents will have to write a term paper that is related to their master's thesis, carefully applying the reading list and knowledge they acquired from the course."},{"code":"M\u00c5L","name":"L\u00e6ringsm\u00e5l","text":"* To familiarize students with a range of participatory, child-focused methods and ethics. \r\n* To enable students design and carry out independent research with children in diverse settings and contexts. \r\n* To provide students with training in critically evaluating current scholarships on the social, moral, ethical and practical challenges of undertaking scientific research with children and young people."},{"code":"ANBFORK","name":"Anbefalte forkunnskaper","text":"See required previous knowledge."},{"code":"FORK","name":"Forkunnskapskrav","text":"Admittance to the course requires a bachelor's degree in a social science or humanities discipline, or equivalent."},{"code":"INNHOLD","name":"Faglig innhold","text":"The course focuses on research tools, techniques and ethics, rather than methodology. It takes its points of departure on the idea that children are social actors with agency, who create and use meanings and are subjects of human rights. It follows that they have the right to be properly researched, enabled to share their views and experiences through methods that are both scientific and ethical. The course is practical and experiential \u0096 students will practice how to design and use a variety of research methods that should be useful for data collection in their own MPhil research projects."},{"code":"KURSMAT","name":"Kursmateriell","text":"Information will be given at the beginning of the semester."}],"assessment":[{"code":"O","codeName":"Oppgave","combinationCode":"O2","combinationName":"Oppgave","firstExecutionYear":2012,"firstExecutionTerm":"Autumn","realExecutionYear":2012,"realExecutionTerm":"Autumn","statusCode":"ORD","statusName":"Ordin\u00e6r eksamen","gradeWeightingNumerator":100,"gradeWeightingDenominator":100,"duration":0,"assessmentFormCode":"O","assessmentFormDescription":"Oppgave","assessmentTimeCode":"12","partNr":1,"submissionDate":"2012-12-18","gradeRuleScheme":"30","gradeRuleSchemeName":"Bokstavkarakterer","gradeRuleUnit":"30","gradeRuleUnitName":"Bokstavkarakterer"},{"code":"O","codeName":"Oppgave","combinationCode":"O2","combinationName":"Oppgave","firstExecutionYear":2013,"firstExecutionTerm":"Spring","realExecutionYear":2013,"realExecutionTerm":"Spring","statusCode":"ORD","statusName":"Ordin\u00e6r eksamen","gradeWeightingNumerator":100,"gradeWeightingDenominator":100,"duration":0,"deadlineBackOut":"2013-04-30","assessmentFormCode":"O","assessmentFormDescription":"Oppgave","assessmentTimeCode":"06","partNr":1,"registrationDeadline":"2013-02-15","submissionDate":"2013-05-30","gradeRuleScheme":"30","gradeRuleSchemeName":"Bokstavkarakterer","gradeRuleUnit":"30","gradeRuleUnitName":"Bokstavkarakterer"}],"educationLanguage":[{"code":"ENGELSK","name":"Engelsk","norwegianName":"Engelsk","englishName":"English"}],"educationTerm":[{"termNum":1,"startTerm":"Spring","termApplies":"Spring","year":2013,"yearIncrement":0,"registrationDeadline":"2013-02-15","numOfRegistratedStudents":0}],"mandatoryActivity":[{"number":1,"name":"Compulsory attendance in all the training workshop days, including active participation in the sessions."}],"subjectArea":[{"code":"11229","name":"Barndomsstudier","norwegianName":"Barndomsstudier","newNorwegianName":"Barndomsstudier","englishName":"Childhood Studies"},{"code":"SAMVIT","name":"Samfunnsvitenskapelige fag","norwegianName":"Samfunnsvitenskapelige fag","newNorwegianName":"Samfunnsvitskaplege fag","englishName":"Social Sciences"}],"creditReduction":[{"courseCode":"BARN3002","weightRuleCode":5583,"creditsReduction":4,"creditsTypeReduction":"SP","ruleTypeCode":"ORD","fromDate":"2010-09-01"},{"courseCode":"BARN3200","weightRuleCode":5582,"creditsReduction":7.5,"creditsTypeReduction":"SP","ruleTypeCode":"ORD","fromDate":"2010-09-01"}],"usedInStudyprogrammes":[{"code":"MPCHILD","name":"Childhood Studies","englishName":"Childhood Studies","statusUseCourseProgrammeConnectionInReporting":true,"statusPublishCourseInfoAsPartOfStudyProgramme":true,"requireSelectedInEducationPlan":false}]},"cache":{"updated":"2012-10-27T19:25:46+02:00","expires":"2012-11-03T18:25:46+01:00"},"request":{"courseCode":"barn3201","year":"2012","term":"autumn","language":"no"}}
